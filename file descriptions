What each file is: 
**Experiment:** doing FBA on the ecoli model to compare the growth rates for anaerobic and aerobic conditions (also created metabolic maps and heatmaps).

**EcoliAssignment:** This code is for single reaction and gene deletion on the ecoli model and making heatmaps also compares anaerobic and aerobic conditions
**reaTutorial:** This is the reaction essentiality analysis across multiple models that I did using ATP synthase as the objective function.

**EcoliAssignmentPt2:** Doing a flux variabilty analysis on the ecoli model and made a heatmap to compare min and max values.
**ATPecoli:** Uses ATPS4r (ATP synthase) as the objective function for single reaction and gene deletion on the ecoli model and making heatmaps also compares anaerobic and aerobic conditions
